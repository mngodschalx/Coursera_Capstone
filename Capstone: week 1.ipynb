Consumer behavior has increasingly shifted from brick-and-mortar stores to online retailers[^1]. However, a physical store is not only a place where customers transact, it also brings brand marketing benefits that could convert directly to online sales[^2]. The location of the store is important to attract the right quality and quantity of foot traffic[^3], i.e potential customers. \n\nAs the store targets the above medium-income female population between 25 and 50 years old, this project aims to identify the neighborhood where the target audience lives and is likely to spend its spare time dinning and shopping. \n\n[^1]: https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/osdc/retail-sector-new-york-city-recent-trends-and-impact-covid-19\n[^2]: https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2019/09/just-how-important-is-a-retailers-location-location-location/#:~:text=It's%20commonly%20believed%20good%20location,it%20faces%20from%20other%20businesses.\n[^3]: https://www.getdor.com/blog/2019/12/05/factors-affect-foot-traffic/"

The dataset is derived from the American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The ACS is an annual survey that collects information about personal and housing characteristics of a sample of one in 40 housing units. The data contains the 2019 1-Year Estimates and was geographically specified on the level of Public Use Micro Areas (PUMA) to the 10 NYC-Manhattan Communnity Districts as shown in the table below. Please note that U.S. Census Bureau combines the Community Districts Manhattan 1 and 2, and Manhattan 7 and 8, into two sub-borough areas to improve sampling and protect the confidentiality of respondents [^4]. The following two tables were retrieved from https://data.census.gov/cedsci/all on 05/02/2021.\n\nB01001 (Age by Sex): displays the distribution of the male and female population in each community district. The data will be used to identify where our target audience (female between 25 and 50 years) live.\n\nB19001 (Median Income): displays the medium income in each community district. The data will be used to identify how much our target audience could spend.\n\n[^4]: https://furmancenter.org/stateofthecity/view/rankings-data-and-methods"

The demographic and socio-economic characteristics from each Community District can be assigned to the neighborhoods of each Community District. \n\nThe scrape resulted in 112 rows and was coverted into 2 columns and 65 rows, representing the 12 Community District and 63 unique Neighborhoods. Closer inspection revealed that the neighborhoods Murray Hill and Gramercy are both in Community District 5 and 6. This means that for these two neighborhoods the demographic and socio-economic data should be an average of Community District 5 and 6. "

These location data points are used to define the parameters for the data from Foursquare to locate nearby venues. The proximity to other shops, restaurants, and other kind of venues will affect the attractiveness of the new location for the store.\n\nThe initial dataset included all 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods of New York City. After filtering to data to only include the neighborhoods of Manhattan, 40 neighborhoods were identified. The number of neighborhoods does not correspodent with the 65 neighborhoods found in 2.2. Closer inspection revealed that the 25 additional neighborhoods are parks, islands or located within a neighborhood. It was therefore decided to only include the 40 neighborhoods from this dataset."
